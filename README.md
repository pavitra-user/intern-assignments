# Intern Algorithm Assignments

This repository contains three algorithm problems designed for implementation assignments, each framed within the context of Indian legal practice.

The problems are designed to be completed within 1-2 hours each and include detailed problem statements, input/output specifications, example test cases, edge cases, and requirements. PDF versions of each problem statement are available in the `pdfs/` directory for easy reference and distribution.
